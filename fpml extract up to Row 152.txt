Extracted information:

The provided FpML XML code contains information about a swaption trade. The trade has two parties, partyA and partyB, and involves a European exercise swaption with an expiration date of 2021-09-30. The swaption is based on the SONIA index and has a fixed leg and a floating leg. The fixed leg is based on the GBP-SONIA-OIS Compound index and has a notional amount of 10000000 GBP. The floating leg is based on the GBP-SONIA-OIS Compound index and has a notional amount of 2200000 GBP. The swaption has an exercise procedure of manual exercise with a fallback exercise provision. The swaption also has a physical settlement provision with a cleared physical settlement of true and a mutually agreed clearinghouse of ABC CENTRAL PARTY CLEARING SVC LTD. The swaption has a payment amount of 22000000 GBP, which is paid on an unadjusted date of 2021-09-30 with date adjustments of business day convention: FOLLOWING and business centers: GBLO. The swaption also has an early termination provision with a mandatory early termination provision that can be exercised by partyB on or before 2021-09-29.
