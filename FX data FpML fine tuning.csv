It is not relying on any communication (written or oral) of the other party as investment advice or as a recommendation to enter into that Transaction; it being understood that information and explanations related to the terms and conditions of a Transaction shall not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to enter into that Transaction. No communication (written or oral) received from the other party shall be deemed to be an assurance or guarantee as to the expected results of that Transaction.  (b) Assessment and Understanding.

It is also capable of assuming, and assumes, the risks of that Transaction.   (c) Status of Parties. The other party is not acting as a fiduciary for or an adviser to it in respect of that Transaction  8. Disclosure  and/or its Affiliates may, in its discretion, decide to engage in hedging activities with respect to the FX Transaction. Such activities may include buying and selling, on a dynamic basis, the underlying currency in the spot market or entering into derivatives on such currency. The hedging strategy may entail unwinding the hedge when a trigger event occurs under the FX Transaction.  and/or its Affiliate may anticipate such event occurring and begin unwinding the hedge before such event occurs, or our hedging strategy may require greater and more frequent dynamic adjustments to the hedge as market prices approach the trigger. Unwinding or adjusting the hedge typically consists of buying or selling a quantity of the underlying currencies, or terminating or entering into derivatives positions with market counterparties. This activity may affect the likelihood of the trigger event occurring or not occurring. In addition, currency or currency derivative transactions that we execute in other capacities (such as trading for proprietary accounts, for accounts under management or to facilitate transactions on behalf of customers) may affect the probability that a trigger event will occur.  9.

The hedging strategy may entail unwinding the hedge when a trigger event occurs under the FX Transaction. and/or its Affiliate may anticipate such event occurring and begin unwinding the hedge before such event occurs, or our hedging strategy may require greater and more frequent dynamic adjustments to the hedge as market prices approach the trigger.

This activity may affect the likelihood of the trigger event occurring or not occurring. In addition, currency or currency derivative transactions that we execute in other capacities (such as trading for proprietary accounts, for accounts under management or to facilitate transactions on behalf of customers) may affect the probability that a trigger event will occur.  8.

  8. Disclosure:  and/or its Affiliates may, in its discretion, decide to engage in hedging activities with respect to the FX Transaction. Such activities may include buying and selling, on a dynamic basis, the underlying currency in the spot market or entering into derivatives on such currency. The hedging strategy may entail unwinding the hedge when a trigger event occurs under the FX Transaction. and/or its Affiliate may anticipate such event occurring and begin unwinding the hedge before such event occurs, or our hedging strategy may require greater and more frequent dynamic adjustments to the hedge as market prices approach the trigger. Unwinding or adjusting the hedge typically consists of buying or selling a quantity of the underlying currencies, or terminating or entering into derivatives positions with market counterparties. This activity may affect the likelihood of the trigger event occurring or not occurring. In addition, currency or currency derivative transactions that we execute in other capacities (such as trading for proprietary accounts, for accounts under management or to facilitate transactions on behalf of customers) may affect the probability that a trigger event will occur.  9.

Disclosure  and/or its Affiliates may, in its discretion, decide to engage in hedging activities with respect to the FX Transaction. Such activities may include buying and selling, on a dynamic basis, the underlying currency in the spot market or entering into derivatives on such currency. The hedging strategy may entail unwinding the hedge when a trigger event occurs under the FX Transaction. and/or its Affiliate may anticipate such event occurring and begin unwinding the hedge before such event occurs, or our hedging strategy may require greater and more frequent dynamic adjustments to the hedge as market prices approach the trigger. Unwinding or adjusting the hedge typically consists of buying or selling a quantity of the underlying currencies, or terminating or entering into derivatives positions with market counterparties. This activity may affect the likelihood of the trigger event occurring or not occurring. In addition, currency or currency derivative transactions that we execute in other capacities (such as trading for proprietary accounts, for accounts under management or to facilitate transactions on behalf of customers) may affect the probability that a trigger event will occur.  6.

The hedging strategy may entail unwinding the hedge when a trigger event occurs under the FX Transaction. and/or its Affiliate may anticipate such event occurring and begin unwinding the hedge before such event occurs, or our hedging strategy may require greater and more frequent dynamic adjustments to the hedge as market prices approach the trigger. Unwinding or adjusting the hedge typically consists of buying or selling a quantity of the underlying currencies, or terminating or entering into derivatives positions with market counterparties. This activity may affect the likelihood of the trigger event occurring or not occurring. In addition, currency or currency derivative transactions that we execute in other capacities (such as trading for proprietary accounts, for accounts under management or to facilitate transactions on behalf of customers) may affect the probability that a trigger event will occur.  6.

Disclosure and/or its Affiliates may, in its discretion, decide to engage in hedging activities with respect to the FX Transaction. Such activities may include buying and selling, on a dynamic basis, the underlying currency in the spot market or entering into derivatives on such currency. The hedging strategy may entail unwinding the hedge when a trigger event occurs under the FX Transaction. and/or its Affiliate may anticipate such event occurring and begin unwinding the hedge before such event occurs, or our hedging strategy may require greater and more frequent dynamic adjustments to the hedge as market prices approach the trigger. Unwinding or adjusting the hedge typically consists of buying or selling a quantity of the underlying currencies, or terminating or entering into derivatives positions with market counterparties. This activity may affect the likelihood of the trigger event occurring or not occurring. In addition, currency or currency derivative transactions that we execute in other capacities (such as trading for proprietary accounts, for accounts under management or to facilitate transactions on behalf of customers) may affect the probability that a trigger event will occur. 9.

The definitions and provisions contained in the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions (the “FX Definitions”) as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., the Emerging Markets Traders Association and The Foreign Exchange Committee. are incorporated into this Confirmation. In the event of any inconsistency between the FX Definitions and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will prevail.  If you and we are parties to either an ISDA Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement (for which purposes this Transaction shall constitute a “Swap Transaction”) or an ISDA Master Agreement (in each case an “Agreement”) then this Confirmation supplements, forms part of and is subject to such Agreement.  If you and we are not yet parties to an Agreement then this Confirmation evidences a complete and binding agreement between Party A and Party B as to the terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates. In addition Party A and Party B agree to use all reasonable efforts promptly to negotiate, execute and deliver an agreement in the form of the ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency – Cross Border) (the “ISDA Form”) with such modifications as you and we will in good faith agree. Upon execution by Party A and Party B of such an agreement, this Confirmation will supplement, form part of, and be subject to that agreement. All provisions contained or incorporated by reference in that agreement upon its execution will govern this Confirmation. Until we execute and deliver that agreement, this Confirmation, together with all other documents referring to the ISDA Form (each a “Confirmation”) confirming transactions (each a “Transaction”) entered into between us (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Confirmation) shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to an agreement in the form of the ISDA Form as if we had executed an agreement on the Trade Date of the first such Transaction between us and such form with the schedule thereto (i) specifying only that (a) the governing law is English law and (b) the Termination Currency is U.S. Dollars, (ii) incorporating the addition to the definition of the “Indemnifiable Tax” contained in (page 48 of) the ISDA “Users Guide to the 1992 ISDA Master Agreements” and (iii) incorporating any other modifications to the ISDA Form specified below.   The terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates are as follows:  3 4.24 4.28  4 4.24 4.28  5 4.24 4.28  6 4.24 4.28  7 4.24 4.28  8 4.24 4.28  9 4.24 4.28  10 4.24 4.28  11 4.24 4.28  12 4.24 4.28   3. Notional Amount Provisions  If the Spot Rate is, on an Observation Date, greater than the relevant Settlement Rate and less than the relevant Barrier Level, the Notional Amount for that particular Transaction shall be adjusted to zero. If the Spot Rate is, on an Observation Date, greater than or equal to the relevant Barrier Level, the Notional Amount for that particular Transaction shall be adjusted to the Leveraged Notional Amount.   4. Termination Provisions  ""As further set out within the following, it is a term of each FX Transaction documented by this Confirmation that the parties' remaining scheduled settlement obligations in respect of each such FX Transaction shall be reduced to zero in the event that the Trigger Level is breached (a “Target Profit Event”)  Where:  ""Trigger Level"" means 0.3  A Target Profit Event shall be deemed to have occurred in the event that the Accumulated Trigger Factor is equal to or exceeds the Trigger Level on any Observation Date.""  The Accumulated Trigger Factor is the sum of each Trigger Factor calculated on each Observation Date in accordance with the following.  The ""Trigger Factor"" shall be calculated on each Observation Date by the Calculation Agent as follows:  Max [0, (Settlement Rate – Observed Spot Rate)]  Where:   ""Observed Spot Rate"" means the Spot Rate observed by the Calculation Agent on the relevant Observation Date.   For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Accumulated Trigger Factor exceeds the Trigger Level on any Observation Date (a “Target Profit Event”), the parties shall pay their next scheduled settlement obligations on the next scheduled Settlement Date with the Notional Amount being adjusted in accordance with the following: -   Notional Amount * [Remaining Trigger Factor / (Settlement Rate - Observed Spot Rate)]  Where Remaining Trigger Factor shall be calculated as follows: -   Trigger Level - Accumulated Trigger Factor calculated immediately following the previous Observation Date.  Upon the occurrence of a Target Profit Event, all remaining payments scheduled to be made by either party on all following scheduled Settlement Dates shall be reduced to zero and neither party shall make any further payments in respect of any FX Transaction documented by this Confirmation.    5. Representations:   Each party represents to the other party as of the date that it enters into this Transaction that (absent a written agreement between the parties that expressly imposes affirmative obligations to the contrary for this Transaction):  (i) Non-Reliance.

The definitions and provisions contained in the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions (the “FX Definitions”) as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., the Emerging Markets Traders Association and The Foreign Exchange Committee. are incorporated into this Confirmation. In the event of any inconsistency between the FX Definitions and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will prevail.  If you and we are parties to either an ISDA Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement (for which purposes this Transaction shall constitute a “Swap Transaction”) or an ISDA Master Agreement (in each case an “Agreement”) then this Confirmation supplements, forms part of and is subject to such Agreement.  If you and we are not yet parties to an Agreement then this Confirmation evidences a complete and binding agreement between Party A and Party B as to the terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates. In addition Party A and Party B agree to use all reasonable efforts promptly to negotiate, execute and deliver an agreement in the form of the ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency – Cross Border) (the “ISDA Form”) with such modifications as you and we will in good faith agree. Upon execution by Party A and Party B of such an agreement, this Confirmation will supplement, form part of, and be subject to that agreement. All provisions contained or incorporated by reference in that agreement upon its execution will govern this Confirmation. Until we execute and deliver that agreement, this Confirmation, together with all other documents referring to the ISDA Form (each a “Confirmation”) confirming transactions (each a “Transaction”) entered into between us (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Confirmation) shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to an agreement in the form of the ISDA Form as if we had executed an agreement on the Trade Date of the first such Transaction between us and such form with the schedule thereto (i) specifying only that (a) the governing law is English law and (b) the Termination Currency is U.S. Dollars, (ii) incorporating the addition to the definition of the “Indemnifiable Tax” contained in (page 48 of) the ISDA “Users Guide to the 1992 ISDA Master Agreements” and (iii) incorporating any other modifications to the ISDA Form specified below.   The terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates are as follows:  3 4.24 4.28  4 4.24 4.28  5 4.24 4.28  6 4.24 4.28  7 4.24 4.28  8 4.24 4.28  9 4.24 4.28  10 4.24 4.28  11 4.24 4.28  12 4.24 4.28   3. Notional Amount Provisions  If the Spot Rate is, on an Observation Date, greater than the relevant Settlement Rate and less than the relevant Barrier Level, the Notional Amount for that particular Transaction shall be adjusted to zero. If the Spot Rate is, on an Observation Date, greater than or equal to the relevant Barrier Level, the Notional Amount for that particular Transaction shall be adjusted to the Leveraged Notional Amount.   4. Termination Provisions  ""As further set out within the following, it is a term of each FX Transaction documented by this Confirmation that the parties' remaining scheduled settlement obligations in respect of each such FX Transaction shall be reduced to zero in the event that the Trigger Level is breached (a “Target Profit Event”)  Where:  ""Trigger Level"" means 0.3  A Target Profit Event shall be deemed to have occurred in the event that the Accumulated Trigger Factor is equal to or exceeds the Trigger Level on any Observation Date.""  The Accumulated Trigger Factor is the sum of each Trigger Factor calculated on each Observation Date in accordance with the following.  The ""Trigger Factor"" shall be calculated on each Observation Date by the Calculation Agent as follows:  Max [0, (Settlement Rate – Observed Spot Rate)]  Where:   ""Observed Spot Rate"" means the Spot Rate observed by the Calculation Agent on the relevant Observation Date.   For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Accumulated Trigger Factor exceeds the Trigger Level on any Observation Date (a “Target Profit Event”), the parties shall pay their next scheduled settlement obligations on the next scheduled Settlement Date with the Notional Amount being adjusted in accordance with the following: -   Notional Amount * [Remaining Trigger Factor / (Settlement Rate - Observed Spot Rate)]  Where Remaining Trigger Factor shall be calculated as follows: -   Trigger Level - Accumulated Trigger Factor calculated immediately following the previous Observation Date.  Upon the occurrence of a Target Profit Event, all remaining payments scheduled to be made by either party on all following scheduled Settlement Dates shall be reduced to zero and neither party shall make any further payments in respect of any FX Transaction documented by this Confirmation.    5.

The definitions and provisions contained in the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions (the “FX Definitions”) as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., the Emerging Markets Traders Association and The Foreign Exchange Committee. are incorporated into this Confirmation. In the event of any inconsistency between the FX Definitions and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will prevail.  If you and we are parties to either an ISDA Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement (for which purposes this Transaction shall constitute a “Swap Transaction”) or an ISDA Master Agreement (in each case an “Agreement”) then this Confirmation supplements, forms part of and is subject to such Agreement.  If you and we are not yet parties to an Agreement then this Confirmation evidences a complete and binding agreement between Party A and Party B as to the terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates. In addition Party A and Party B agree to use all reasonable efforts promptly to negotiate, execute and deliver an agreement in the form of the ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency – Cross Border) (the “ISDA Form”) with such modifications as you and we will in good faith agree. Upon execution by Party A and Party B of such an agreement, this Confirmation will supplement, form part of, and be subject to that agreement. All provisions contained or incorporated by reference in that agreement upon its execution will govern this Confirmation. Until we execute and deliver that agreement, this Confirmation, together with all other documents referring to the ISDA Form (each a “Confirmation”) confirming transactions (each a “Transaction”) entered into between us (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Confirmation) shall supplement, form a part of, and be subject to an agreement in the form of the ISDA Form as if we had executed an agreement on the Trade Date of the first such Transaction between us and such form with the schedule thereto (i) specifying only that (a) the governing law is English law and (b) the Termination Currency is U.S. Dollars, (ii) incorporating the addition to the definition of the “Indemnifiable Tax” contained in (page 48 of) the ISDA “Users Guide to the 1992 ISDA Master Agreements” and (iii) incorporating any other modifications to the ISDA Form specified below.   The terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates are as follows:  3 4.24 4.28  4 4.24 4.28  5 4.24 4.28  6 4.24 4.28  7 4.24 4.28  8 4.24 4.28  9 4.24 4.28  10 4.24 4.28  11 4.24 4.28  12 4.24 4.28   3. Notional Amount Provisions  If the Spot Rate is, on an Observation Date, greater than the relevant Settlement Rate and less than the relevant Barrier Level, the Notional Amount for that particular Transaction shall be adjusted to zero. If the Spot Rate is, on an Observation Date, greater than or equal to the relevant Barrier Level, the Notional Amount for that particular Transaction shall be adjusted to the Leveraged Notional Amount.   4. Termination Provisions  ""As further set out within the following, it is a term of each FX Transaction documented by this Confirmation that the parties' remaining scheduled settlement obligations in respect of each such FX Transaction shall be reduced to zero in the event that the Trigger Level is breached (a “Target Profit Event”)  Where:  ""Trigger Level"" means 0.3  A Target Profit Event shall be deemed to have occurred in the event that the Accumulated Trigger Factor is equal to or exceeds the Trigger Level on any Observation Date.""  The Accumulated Trigger Factor is the sum of each Trigger Factor calculated on each Observation Date in accordance with the following.  The ""Trigger Factor"" shall be calculated on each Observation Date by the Calculation Agent as follows:  Max [0, (Settlement Rate – Observed Spot Rate)]  Where:   ""Observed Spot Rate"" means the Spot Rate observed by the Calculation Agent on the relevant Observation Date.   For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Accumulated Trigger Factor exceeds the Trigger Level on any Observation Date (a “Target Profit Event”), the parties shall pay their next scheduled settlement obligations on the next scheduled Settlement Date with the Notional Amount being adjusted in accordance with the following: -   Notional Amount * [Remaining Trigger Factor / (Settlement Rate - Observed Spot Rate)]  Where Remaining Trigger Factor shall be calculated as follows: -   Trigger Level - Accumulated Trigger Factor calculated immediately following the previous Observation Date.  Upon the occurrence of a Target Profit Event, all remaining payments scheduled to be made by either party on all following scheduled Settlement Dates shall be reduced to zero and neither party shall make any further payments in respect of any FX Transaction documented by this Confirmation.    5. Representations:   Each party represents to the other party as of the date that it enters into this Transaction that (absent a written agreement between the parties that expressly imposes affirmative obligations to the contrary for this Transaction):  (i) Non-Reliance.  It is acting for its own account, and it has made its own independent decisions to enter into this Transaction and as to whether the Transaction is appropriate or proper for it based upon its own judgement and upon advice from such advisers as it has deemed necessary.

deemed necessary. It is not relying on any communication (written or oral) of the other party

to the FX Transaction. Such activities may include buying and selling, on a dynamic basis, 
the underlying currency in the spot market or entering into derivatives o n such currency. The   
 hedging strategy may entail unwinding the hedge when a trigger event occurs under the FX 
Transaction. and/or its Affiliate may anticipate such event occurring and begin unwinding the 
hedge before such event occurs, or our hedging strat egy may require greater and more 
frequent dynamic adjustments to the hedge as market prices approach the trigger. Unwinding 
or adjusting the hedge typically consists of buying or selling a quantity of the underlying 
currencies, or terminating or entering i nto derivatives positions with market counterparties. 
This activity may affect the likelihood of the trigger event occurring or not occurring. In 
addition, currency or currency derivative transactions that we execute in other capacities 
(such as trading fo r proprietary accounts, for accounts under management or to facilitate 
transactions on behalf of customers) may affect the probability that a trigger event will occur.

the underlying currency in the spot market or entering into derivatives o n such currency. The   
 hedging strategy may entail unwinding the hedge when a trigger event occurs under the FX 
Transaction. and/or its Affiliate may anticipate such event occurring and begin unwinding the 
hedge before such event occurs, or our hedging strat egy may require greater and more 
frequent dynamic adjustments to the hedge as market prices approach the trigger. Unwinding 
or adjusting the hedge typically consists of buying or selling a quantity of the underlying 
currencies, or terminating or entering i nto derivatives positions with market counterparties. 
This activity may affect the likelihood of the trigger event occurring or not occurring. In 
addition, currency or currency derivative transactions that we execute in other capacities 
(such as trading fo r proprietary accounts, for accounts under management or to facilitate 
transactions on behalf of customers) may affect the probability that a trigger event will occur.

strategy may require greater and more frequent dyn amic adjustments to the hedge as market prices 
approach the trigger. Unwinding or adjusting the he dge typically consists of buying or selling a quantity 
of the underlying currencies, or terminating or entering into derivatives positions with market 
counterparties. This activity may affect the likelihoo d of the trigger event occurring or not occurring. In 
addition, currency or currency derivative transactions that we execute in other capacities (such as trading 
for proprietary accounts, for accounts under management  or to facilitate transactions on behalf of 
customers) may affect the probability that a trigger event will occur.
